        Class implementing the UDP version of the client protocol.

            You must write the implementation of this class.

        Each instance must have at least the following attribute:

        .. attribute:: serverProxy

            The serverProxy, which the protocol must use
            to interact with the user and movie store in the server.

        .. attribute:: clientAddress

            The IP address (or the name) of the c2w server.

        .. attribute:: clientPort

            The port number used by the c2w server.

        .. note::
            You must add attributes and methods to this class in order
            to have a working and complete implementation of the c2w
            protocol.

        .. note::
            The IP address and port number of the client are provided
            only for the sake of completeness, you do not need to use
            them, as a TCP connection is already associated with only
            one client.
